# Parsers

Woah, finding a good parser libary is hard

- All the parser libraries with a custom DSL - Yeah, learning a new language just to write a parser is weird
- https://github.com/jneen/parsimmon - No Typescript
- https://github.com/wavebeem/bread-n-butter/ - Decent parser library, but not being worked on
- https://github.com/microsoft/ts-parsec - Maybe in the future?
- `grammar-ite.ts` - We could totally write our own parsers. As for handling complicated precedence rules and associativity in math expressions, apparently that can be done in a secondary step https://github.com/Chevrotain/chevrotain/issues/387#issuecomment-285943243
